Greeshma Jale
creating my first repository
I have added a new line to the repo

For **bold text** you can __use__ * or _.
You can bold inside a word Un**it**e using 
*, but _ may be unpredictable.
*This is italics.*
***Pay attention.***


Paragraph 1 is not very long.
But it does have a second sentence
Paragraph 2 is also not very long.<br>
But it uses a line break.

> Quoting the first paragraph.
>
>Includes the next paragraph if we include 
the blank line separator.
And we can nest.
>> Nested!
And the last line of the second paragraph 
is still quoted.

```
def sumIt (n):
x = 0
for x in range(0,n):
sum += x
return sum
```


* Go to the store
* Buy Food
* Rice
* Beans
* Come home



1. Go to the store
2. Buy Food
1. Rice (indented.. So start at 1)
6. Beans
1. Come home
2. After coming home
3. And this should be the final line.




Before the rule we want a blank line
---
And after as well.
